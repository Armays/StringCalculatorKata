Solid Exercices
===============

The goal is to implement a digital calculator from given strings. Some tests are given in advance, some must be added.

Here is the global path of the exercices:

* First we want to implement the Calculator that can calculate simple operations: sums, products, substractions and divisions
	* A first test is given for sum, don't forget to write some for additional cases and other operations
	* Try to avoid exceptions with explicit messages if impossible to calculate
* Then, we have a CalculatorTrainer class that run several operations stored in an array against Calculator, try to extract these operations in a separate class
	* What is the principle you are applying in this case?
*
